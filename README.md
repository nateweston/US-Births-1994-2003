# US-Births-1994-2003
I do some simple analysis of a dataset from FiveThirtyEight that has US birth information from 1994 - 2003.
The dataset contains: year, month (1-12), date_of_month (1-31), day_of_week (1-7), and number of births.
To analyze it I build some simple recursive functions.
I create a function called calc_counts, which can determine the total number of births for any column that is selected. 
I also create a funtion that will return the minimum and maximum values of any dictionary.
